    "## (c): generating puzzles with unique solutions using ASP\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement an algorithm that generates `9`-by-`9` BombKnightSudoku inputs (i.e., `k=3`) that:\n",
    "1. have exactly 10 cells filled with a number between `1` and `9`,\n",
    "1. and have a unique solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, your algorithm should output a generator that iterates over BombKnightSudoku inputs with the required properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your algorithm should use the approach of translating this problem to an answer set program *P*, calling an ASP solver (i.e., clingo) to find answer sets for *P*, and translating these answer sets to BombKnightSudoku inputs with the required properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "(To be clear: you may not 'hardcode' a list of BombKnightSudoku inputs in the answer set program *P*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two variants of this assignment: a harder variant (d.I) and an easier variant (d.II). You may choose which variant you would like to solve.\n",
    "If you opt for the harder variant (d.I), you can get a maximum of 2 points for this assignment.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (c.I) Harder variant (2pts):\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the harder variant, your answer set program *P* should be such that for **each** BombKnightSudoku input *I* with the required properties, there is an answer set of *P* that corresponds to *I*. For this, you should express in *P* the constraints 1. (that exactly 10 cells are filled) and 2. (that the input has a unique solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Use the technique of saturation to express constraint 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (c.II) Easier variant (1pt):\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the easier variant, your answer set program *P* only needs to be such that for **a subset of** BombKnightSudoku inputs *I* with the required properties, there is an answer set of *P* that corresponds to *I*. For this, you could express in *P*, in addition to the constraint 1. (that exactly 10 cells are filled), some other property that entails constraint 2. (that the input has a unique solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* If a Sudoku input can be solved using some [basic strategies](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/Mahmood/Solve.html), it must have a unique solution. Consider variants of these basic strategies for BombKnightSudoku."
